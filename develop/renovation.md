- Installing a mechanism to isolate the requirements of a python project 

`pip install pipreqs`

- This one doesn't work as of yet.

- Perhaps I should move to maintaining a proper conda env for this.


- `cookiecutter` is gonna be my template generator overall and I shall move to `conda` for my environment management and `bazel` for build systems. 

- `pip install cookiecutter`

- Moving the project to this template `cookiecutter https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science`
